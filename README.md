### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Molly Stewart-Gallus.

I guess right now I'm just working on my portfolio.

### I'm currently learning

Lately I've been working on [formalizing a small amount of category
theory](https://github.com/mstewartgallus/category-fun) in
[Coq](https://coq.inria.fr/).

I'm playing around with type systems and formal methods right now and
I'm hopeful category theory can help with this.

I have a hunch you can generalize graded monads and adjunctions for a
sort of graded [Call By Push
Value](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Call-by-push-value) which ought
to be useful for a compiler IR to simplify optimization.
