### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Molly Stewart-Gallus.

I guess right now I'm just working on my portfolio.

### I'm currently learning

Lately I've been working on [formalizing a small amount of category
theory](https://github.com/mstewartgallus/category-fun) in
[Coq](https://coq.inria.fr/).

I'm playing around with type systems and formal methods right now and
I'm hopeful category theory can help with this.

I have a hunch you can generalize graded monads and adjunctions for a
sort of graded [Call By Push
Value](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Call-by-push-value) which ought
to be useful for a compiler IR to simplify optimization.

### In the past

I've also been playing with technologies like [PLT
Redex](https://redex.racket-lang.org/) and
[Makam](http://astampoulis.github.io/makam/) (a dialect of Lambda
Prolog) for rapid prototyping of programming language interpreters.

You can see a tiny demo language in PLT Redex [here](https://github.com/mstewartgallus/playground/blob/master/coexp.rkt)

A little language in Makam
[here](https://github.com/mstewartgallus/coc-makam) . Makam works
great for simply typed languages but full dependent types are **way
too** complicated in any implementation.

I also played a [little bit](https://github.com/mstewartgallus/peacod)
with GraalVM but I found it too complicated for initial
experimentation.  Also GraalVM had troubles with tail recursion at the
time which made it hard to implement functional languages.

I got heavily into low-level details of the JVM for a while.  I
learned to [use](https://github.com/mstewartgallus/heaps) ByteBuddy
and invokedynamic to insert dynamically optimizable spots into a Java
program.

I got heavily into lock-free programming for a while and
[played](https://github.com/mstewartgallus/stacklock) with making a
more efficient unfair lock implementation based on the MCS Queue that
uses a stack instead. I also tried formalizing a little bit of it in
TLA+.

In the past I got into hard real-time and safety critical stuff for a
while. I
[experimented](https://github.com/mstewartgallus/linted/tree/master)
with breaking a program into separate processes some of which are
verifiable in a safe dialect of Ada. The lock-free queue is probably
broken.  I didn't really get how Ada SPARK was meant to handle
concurrency.

### Addendum

I am a trans woman. I used to go by the name "Steven" and use the
email stevenselectronicmail@gmail.com . These details may pop up in
older work.  I do not use the name or email anymore.
